🏧 Simple ATM Simulation in Python 💻
Excited to share one of my beginner-level Python projects — a Simple ATM System that simulates basic banking operations through a console interface.

🔐 Key Functionalities:

User login system with file-based authentication (login-credentials.txt)

💰 View account balance

💸 Deposit money

🏦 Withdraw money (with insufficient balance check)

📋 Menu-based loop to perform continuous operations

🛠️ How It Works:

The program starts by asking the user to log in with a valid username and password. These credentials are verified against a text file storing login details. After successful login, the user can:

Check balance

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Exit the session

💡 Initial Configuration:

Username: john

Password: 12345

Starting Balance: ₹1000

🧠 What I Practiced:

File handling

Functions and conditionals

Menu-driven programs

Input validation and control flow

This project helped me understand the importance of modular code structure and data validation. I'm continuously building more such Python projects to sharpen my logic and problem-solving skills.
